      I do language and technology. 
      
      I especially like it when we leverage language technology to further positive, pro-social use cases.

      <br>
      <br> 

      For grad school I've focused on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bCvv9L5hkqg6375emnf1mHFdLQvvDNPu/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">reframing in natural contexts</a>, creating a new text-style transfer dataset and fine-tuning LLMs, motivated by potential mental health applications.

      <br>
      <br> 

      I've also done some other ML and NLP projects! If you're new to Machine Learning, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/arturomp/coursera-machine-learning-in-python#readme" target="_blank">these notebooks</a> where I walk through implementing foundational ML algorithms from scratch.

      You can also take a look at my convolutional neural net for <a href="https://github.com/arturomp/kaggle/blob/master/digit-recognition/cnn-digit-recognition.ipynb" target="_blank">optical character recognition</a>, my Doc2Vec + XGBoost attempt at <a href="https://github.com/arturomp/kaggle/blob/master/quora-question-similarity/quora-question-similarity.ipynb" target="_blank">paraphrase detection of millions of questions</a>, and my approach to taking knowledge from known fields to automatically <a href="https://github.com/arturomp/kaggle/blob/master/stack-exchange-keyword-extraction/Stack-Exchange-keyword-extraction.ipynb" target="_blank">extract keywords from text</a> in a new field. You can also peek at my <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23920798" target="_blank">publication</a> on text classification in a medical setting.

      I also <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/photoprojects/cooking.html">cook</a>, travel and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/photoprojects/travel.html">take pictures</a>, among <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about.html">many other things</a>.
