# ðŸ«¶ Family Memories: A Bilingual AI System to Explore and Revisit Interviews

I have several recorded family interviewsâ€”casual conversations with older relativesâ€”and I want to keep doing more. But I donâ€™t remember exactly where certain things were said. Replaying hours of audio to find one moment isnâ€™t sustainable.

So I built a prototype: something that makes those interviews searchable and easier to interact with, across languages. It helps me revisit moments, trace themes, and build new questions for future interviews.
